# ODL webfw

Webfw is currently used by and tuned to work with https://github.com/OpenDriversLog/goodl

It is not perfectly free of stuff that would better fit in the goodl-project (especially for error handling).

`webfw` provides a lightweight basic MVC-Web-Framework for go.
Inspired by https://github.com/QLeelulu/goku and http://nicolasmerouze.com/build-web-framework-golang
 Will be extended as needs are there.
